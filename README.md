# Starving Artist Simulator - Proposal

Starving Artist Simulator is a browser-based painting game that aims to simulate a small slice of what goes on in the life of a starving artist. With all pretensions aside, the game is essentially a paint app with an objective: the player will aim to recreate various pictures that are presented to them using only very basic painting tools, and with a very limited amount of time. Since the game canonically takes place within the Pokemon Universe, the pictures that the player will be expected to produce will fall into one of two categories: reproductions of famous paintings, and paintings of people's favorite Pokemon.

When time runs out, the player's picture will be compared to the "goal" picture using the resemblejs library. Whatever the player has produced by the end is then scored, and the player themselves are then offered the opportunity to try again with a different randomly-selected picture.
